Initially, SMILE-WIDE is a version of the <a href=\"http://genie.sis.pitt.edu\">SMILE</a> library, \r\naugmented <strong>W</strong>ith <strong>I</strong>ntegrated <strong>D</strong>istributed Execution. \r\nThis allows execution on very large datasets. As SMILE-WIDE is developed, BigData-specific \r\ncapabilities will surpass the standard Bayesian network interfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing the library\r\n-----------------\r\nProgrammer-facing, SMILE-WIDE is a .jar library which you can include in your software. \r\nUser-facing, it is also integrated into Hive as a UDF to provide posterior probabilities \r\nof missing values, given the observed values for each instance.\r\n\r\nLanguages used\r\n--------------\r\nSMILE-WIDE is written in Java, using the underlying SMILE library, which is written in C++. \r\nIt uses Hadoop for inference on large data.\r\n\r\nHow to build the software\r\n-------------------------\r\nSMILE-WIDE is an Eclipse project configured to use Maven. All external dependencies are pulled from the appropriate Maven repositories. The code can be built from the IDE or directly from the command line.\r\n\r\nFurther information\r\n-------------------\r\nFor further information, including how to build, run, and test this software, see the READ-ME.html file included in the distribution (and also online in the GitHub Wiki for this project).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
